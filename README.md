## DIABETIC RETINOPATHY USING CNN
A machine learning-based system designed to detect and classify Diabetic Retinopathy using CNN and VGG16. This project aims to assist in early diagnosis and reduce the risk of blindness by providing a highly accurate and efficient diagnostic tool.

## About
Diabetic Retinopathy is a serious complication of diabetes that affects the retina's blood vessels. This project leverages advanced deep learning algorithms to detect its presence and severity from retinal images. By employing VGG16 and CNN models, the system ensures accurate detection and grading, enabling timely treatment.

## Features
- Automated Detection: Uses pre-trained VGG16 and CNN models for precise image analysis.
- Prediction and Classification: Accurately identifies and categorizes disease severity.
- Interactive Front-End: A user-friendly React-based website for easy access to predictions.
- Model Integration: A Flask API seamlessly integrates the deep learning model with the frontend.
